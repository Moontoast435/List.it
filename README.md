## Overview

A small todo-list app that I made from scratch. I used vanilla JS, making use of the webpack package and organised my code by adhering to SOLID design principles.
The app was principally designed for mobile use, but I will continue to make changes to the styling for desktop use. The app also only makes use of the localstorage in the browser.

## Future features

[x] Create projects with custom names
<br>
[ ] Update the styling some more on both mobile and desktop versions. On Desktop - adjust the sizing of certain elements
