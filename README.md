## Installation & Usage

 * Clone the repo.
 * Navigate to the root of the repository.
 * Type 'npm install' into the console.
 * To start the app, type npm start.

## Overview

A small todo-list app that I made from scratch. I used vanilla JS, making use of the webpack package and organised my code by adhering to SOLID design principles.
The app was principally designed for mobile use, but I will continue to make changes to the styling for desktop use. The app also only makes use of the localstorage in the browser.

## Future features

* I would like to add the ability to rename the projects and have an infinite amount of them.
* Update the styling some more on both mobile and desktop versions
